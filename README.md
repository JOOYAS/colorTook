# Color Picker üé®

A basic color picker built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, supporting **HSLA colors**. This project was created as a learning exercise to experiment for style manipulation using javascript.
But now its a complicated mess

It‚Äôs funny‚Äîselecting HSLA colors is easy, yet with this project, I made a simple thing complicated.

## Features ‚ú®

-   **HSLA Color Support**: Choose colors with full **HSLA** control.
-   **Separate Background and Text Colors**: Set custom colors for both background and text.
-   **Custom Sliders**: All sliders for hue, saturation, lightness, and alpha are built from scratch.
-   **Editable Text**: Type your text and apply colors directly.
-   **Copyable Color Values**: Easily copy the HSLA color values.

## Limitations üêû

-   **Not Responsive**: Designed for desktop only at the moment.
-   **No Color Conversion**: Currently, this project only supports HSLA color format with no conversions to other formats.
-   **Bugs**: Minor bugs may appear during usage (still in progress!). I will try to improve. Since i'm a beginner many things maybe wrong.
